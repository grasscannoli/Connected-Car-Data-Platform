# Connected-Car-Data-Platform
This repository consists of the project designed by Arjun Bharat and Vamsi Krishna for the course CS6023: GPU Programming.

The project was under Prof. Rupesh Nasre.

# Details regarding working:
In the current version, the following features exist:

1] Given a Graph, we can find the single source shortest distance using a parallelized Djikstra Algorithm.

2] Created a Parallelized Database Management System to handle queries. It supports a select, write row, and read operations.

The idea is to use these two rudimentaries in this server, that inputs queries from a client and responds appropriately. This is the backend for the Connected-Car-Data Platform.[ This is yet to be completed.]
